# **Overview**

This repository documents my procedures for developing my ePortfolio as the CS-499 Computer Science Capstone course final project to showcases my unique abilities and talents as one of the best visual communication tools to demonstrate my value to potential employers. The content of the ePortfolio is a solid starting point to clear ideas that showcase my skills across the key fields of Computer Science. The included artifact was previously developed in the Computer Science Program at Southern New Hampshire University and it represents my growth in the key categories of software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.
