# **Overview**

This repository documents my procedures for developing my ePortfolio as the CS-499 Computer Science Capstone course final project to showcases my unique abilities and talents as one of the best visual communication tools to demonstrate my value to potential employers. The content of the ePortfolio is a solid starting point to clear ideas that showcase my skills across the key fields of Computer Science. The included artifact was previously developed in the Computer Science Program at Southern New Hampshire University and it represents my growth in the key categories of software design/engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

## **Self-Reflections**

-The [1-1 Journal](https://github.com/sjpri/sjpri.github.io/blob/f8c110f781c84decbe969383e64a8a5545f0c672/Journals/1-1%20Journal_Gomes-DaCosta.docx) is an informative self-introduction related to the computer science courses concepts applicable to my personal experiences. The journal goes into depth about the length of time I have been in the Computer Science program, the most important concepts and skills learned, what my current career or future career relate to computer science, my career plans, and what specialization I am targeting for my career.-

-The [2-1 Journal](https://github.com/sjpri/sjpri.github.io/blob/20a0313d3002ef1d2ff699185e3e662d84d09cde/Journals/2-1%20Journal_Gomes-DaCosta.docx) was written after reviewing module resources on code review to better understand why it is an essential practice for computer scientists and others in the industry. The paper covers the definition of code review, the reason why it is an important practice for computer science professionals, when and how does it occur, and it lists some code review best practices.-

-[4-1 Journal](https://github.com/sjpri/sjpri.github.io/blob/c434523e9a4fd2c8042055bd925c5b16a4f56d2b/Journals/4-1%20Journal_Gomes-DaCosta-3rdtry.docx) is a reflection on my choice of career and future direction where I shared how I traced the development of my choice of career and plans for the future. It displays how I have been consistent in my goals and includes a recognition received through winning an yearly award.-
